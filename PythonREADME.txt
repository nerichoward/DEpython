Howdy gang,

This directory will contain code programs and examples that we will use in class.
Python is a really useful language that you can use in almost ANY area where you might use a computer - not just for
"computer programming" for engineering reasons, but for networking, and even for simple automation of tasks (like backing
up your photo library on a hard drive).

Enjoy!
